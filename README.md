jprykopcodesamples
==================

Repository for public code samples for Jonathan Prykop

Currently only contains perl module JPrykop::File

This is a code sample from one of my longer-term projects;  I've
swapped out the name of that project with JPrykop in the code,
but otherwise made no changes.  Unfortunately I cannot release enough 
of the overall system for it to compile, I can merely assure you that 
it's been running smoothly for several years.  If given the chance to
do it again, I would make directories their own class rather than leave
them implied by the existence of the files within them.  I would also
seek further integration with os-level file lookup tools to improve
speed.  That said, this module has done a good job avoided conflicts 
and data loss when allowing both external users and other programmers 
to manipulate files on our system.  B<Thanks for your interst in my work!>
